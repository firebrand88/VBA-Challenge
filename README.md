#VBA Challenge

##Description

In this VBA Challenge, we analyze 751,000 rows of historical price and volume stock data.

We return the % changes from the opening and closing prices for each stock and their total volume for the time frame.

We point out which stocks had the greatest % increase and decreases and which had the largest total volumes for each year.
